MESSENGER.COM

TO GRAB TEXT FROM THE SO CALLED "TEXT FIELD"
document.activeElement.textContent
- note, you cannot set this since React keeps a property for an object and resets it, breaks the site

TO SEND A MESSAGE
MessengerComposer, .props.onMessageSend("MESSAGE GOES HERE")

TO CLEAR THE TEXT FIELD
window.strawberry.publicInstance._resetState()
